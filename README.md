# Cost-Of-Living Crisis Microsimulation

This repository contains all material related to this project. Please note that due to size and safeguarding no underlying Synthetic Populations, Shapefiles, etc. are shared.

## SP Comparison
The folder "SP comparison" contains a comparison of two different synthetic populations. SP1 is a classic synthetic population based on individuals whereas SP2 is a household-based synthetic population for which we linked in individual-level information. The comparison of SP1 and SP2 illustrates a typical stumbling block in microsimulation studies surrounding the interconnection of individuals and households.

## Model 1
The folder "Model 1" is a simple microsimulation model for learning and demonstration purposes. In order to reduce runtime, the modelling is kept simple and analysis is only run for Wales and three time steps. Data visualisation for a LSOA resolution.
